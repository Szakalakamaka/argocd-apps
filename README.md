### **Directory Descriptions**
- **`environments/`**: Contains ArgoCD application manifests for each environment (e.g., development, staging, production). Each subdirectory includes configurations specific to that environment.
- **`templates/`**: (Optional) Centralized templates or reusable components, such as Kustomize bases or Helm chart values.

## üöÄ How It Works

### **App of Apps Pattern**
The repository uses the **App of Apps** pattern to manage multiple applications efficiently:
- A **parent application** is defined to manage child applications.
- Each **child application** represents a single service, pointing to its specific configuration in a separate repository or within this repo.

### **Environment-Specific Configurations**
- Each environment (`dev`, `staging`, `production`) has its own directory containing the ArgoCD application manifests for all the applications deployed in that environment.
- Use tools like **Helm** or **Kustomize** to manage configuration differences between environments.
